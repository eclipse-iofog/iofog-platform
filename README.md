# ioFog Platform

ioFog Platform provides a means by which to spin up and deploy an Eclipse ioFog stack on GKE and Packet.

# Requirements

* Gcloud SDK
* Terraform (v0.11.x)
* Ansible
* gcloud
* Kubectl
* Iofogctl

You can run `./bootstrap.sh` in order to download those dependencies.

You will also require the following environment variables
```sh
# If you need to download private packages from packagecloud (Only used to download unstable or dev versions)
# This will be package cloud repository token. NOT the package cloud API token
export PACKAGE_CLOUD_TOKEN=<package_cloud_token>

export PACKET_AUTH_TOKEN=<packet_auth_token> # If you want to deploy agents on Packet

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path-to-json>
```
You can edit the file `./my_credentials.sh` to provide your keys.

## Usage

Run `./bootstrap.sh` to ensure all required dependencies are present and initialise terraform files.
If you didn't have `gcloud` prior to running the bootstrap script, please run:
```sh
  source /usr/local/lib/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc
  source /usr/local/lib/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc
```

Edit the file `./my_vars.tfvars` according to the table below.

To deploy your ioFog stack, run `./deploy.sh`
To destroy your ioFog stack, run `./destroy.sh`

## Iofoctl for Agent Configuration

If you plan to use snapshot repo, you will need to provide package cloud token, leave it empty if installing released version. 

### Helpful Commands

- Login to gcloud: `gcloud auth login`

- Kubeconfig for gke cluster: `gcloud container clusters get-credentials <<CLUSTER_NAME>> --region <<REGION>>`

- Delete a particular terraform resource: `terraform destroy -target=null_resource.iofog -var-file=vars.tfvars -auto-approve`

- Terraform Output `terraform output ` or `terraform output -module=packet_edge_nodes`
